Beneath the hero image is three sections for the different services 'GP Aviation' has to offer.

## Testing
I've tested the website on:
* Safari
* Firefox
* Chrome
* IOS

### Bugs
* Warning: Section lacks heading.
    When validating i got a warning that the hero image section lacked a header.
    Since I didin't want any text in this section I fixed it by adding this:
    ```html
    <section id="hero-image" class="hero-index">
        <h2 class="hidden">GP Aviation</h2>
    </section>
    ```

    ```css
    h2.hidden {
        visibility: hidden;
    }
    ```
* Duplicate ID information.
    I had multiple <div> with the id=information. This is not valid HTML.
    * Changed `id=information` to `class=information`.
    * in style.css i changed `#information` to `.information`
