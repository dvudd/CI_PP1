# GP Aviation
GP Aviation is a homepage for the hypothetical helicopter company based in Sweden focused on selling experience-trips, such as sightseeing tours around Stockholm, short learning sessions with instructors or luxurious transfer trips.

### Header
The header is fixed to the top of the page, with the company logo to the left and the navigation bar to the right.
The logo is clickable and when pressed, it leads back to the Main page.
The navigation bar is collapsed behind the burger icon, when clicked it expands and a links leading to different pages appear.
When viewed on bigger screens, the burger icon becomes invisable and the links are arranged in a row on the header bar.
### Main Page
The main page starts with a wide scenic 'hero' shot from the inside of a helicopter.
Beneath the hero image are three sections, each for the different services 'GP Aviation' has to offer.
Each section starts with a header and a pin to show where the service is available. A short paragraph explains the experience followed by a unordered list which explains how many passengers each service can carry, the estimated length of the ride, as well as where the estimated starting price is currently at. 
Each section ends with a button that leads to the Booking page.

### Booking

The form contains:

* Contact information.

## Testing
I've tested the website on:
* Safari
* Firefox
* Chrome
* IOS
### Bugs
* Warning: Section lacks heading.
When validating i got a warning that the hero image section lacked a header.
Since I didin't want any text in this section I fixed it by adding this:
```html
<section id="hero-image" class="hero-index">
<h2 class="hidden">GP Aviation</h2>
</section>
```

```css
h2.hidden {
visibility: hidden;
}
```

* Duplicate ID information.
I had multiple `<div>` with the `id=information`. This is not valid HTML.
* Changed `id=information` to `class=information`.
* in style.css i changed `#information` to `.information`
